###What the heck's a Shell?
A [shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. The two types of shells are CLIs and GUIs, or command-line interfaces and graphical user interfaces, respectively. The terminal is a CLI whereas Finder (or Sourcetree) is a GUI.

###What's Bash?
Bash is a widely-adopted Unix CLI shell that replaced the Bourne shell in 1989. In order to change preferences with your terminal, you need to edit the bash files. There are two main types of these: one type concerns interactive shell launches and the other - you guessed it - non-interactive shells. An interactive shell launch just means any shell process where you type in commands and get output back - a shell in which you, yup, interact.

###Shell scripts vs. commands
A shell script is something that can manipulate a command but they're somewhat distinct from each other.
